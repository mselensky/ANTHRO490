(2017), found here. Lavoie et al. (2017) used the greengenes database for their analyses, which is not ideal for examining environmental microbial communities. I test several conclusions put forth by the authors: 1) that communities distinctly cluster at the phylum level based on source (i.e., cave vs. surface soil); 2) that cave microbial communities are significantly less diverse than soil communities; and 3) that microbial mat color affects richness. Here, I perform a Qiime2-based analysis of the same data. I instead used the latest Silva database (132.99), with the goal of determining whether my conclusions about within- and between-cave microbial diversity are similar to the those of the initial study.
